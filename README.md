# Bias and Variance

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuBBz3bI-aA&t=0s

- The model fits the training data really well, but not the testing set, we say that the model is overfitting
- There are three commonly used methods for solving overfitting problem is: 
- 1. Regularization
- 2. Boosting
- 3. Bagging
- In machine learing terminology, the difference in fits between testing and training data sets is called variance (or variation)
- The inability for a machine learing model to capture the true relationship in training dataset is called bias
